    libraries needed
    pipeline construction (code)
    First train results -> Overfitting: | Train Acc: 100.00% | Test Acc:   7.50%
        - Add Dropout
        - Reduce model size: (512, 256) -> (128, 64)
        - L2 Reg. (Weight decay)
        - Reduce dimensionality with PCA
        - Reduce learning rate

    Second train results:

    Improvements:  
        Adam vs. Adamw (https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/adamw-optimizer-in-pytorch)
        Use of another atlas (destrieux_2009), since the harvard_oxford didnt have Left hemisphere
        Train on the first participant (sub-p0001), save the model and test on the second participant (sub-p0002)
        Update the layers (dropout, number of nuerons, layers, etc.)
